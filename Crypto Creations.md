# Crypto Creations

The idea of Crypto Creations is that a crypto-currency could be created that has a tangible backing by using the investments of a DNI (Distributed Network of Individuals) to directly purchase and hold assets to which they would then become entitled to an equivalent share.

This would be accomplished by legally registering the DNI as a Non Profit Organization and using that as a public INTERFACE for purposes of purchasing land and assets

Building Blocks would be created for each new Investment on a seperate but connected Block Chain Creating a Block Mesh (combined block chains linked)

Founders of each building block would be required to invest equal shares of funds for the creation of a new block

The control of the assets belonging to a building block held by the DNI would be done Democratically with a OPOV (one person one vote) system

Voting would be anonymous via the private key held to each block of the user block chain being given the privilege of one vote on any given ballot

Founders can sell all or part of their shares. 

If a share is split voting rights would split proportionately.
